                <p>Filian stated herself that she dreamed of doing an award show since late May of 2023. It's been a
                    long journey to get her this far to do it. Though I believe that there are some things to improve
                    in the future, I hope this tradition sticks with her for the rest of her streaming career and beyond.
                    Congratulations to you Filian and cheers to another amazing Award Show âœ¨ðŸ¥‚âœ¨
                </p>

                <h2>summary</h2>
                <h2>backstory --&gt;</h2>
                <p>Once upon a time, in a land far, far away lived a streamer by the name of Filian. She always has a knack
                    at insanely creative things that both entertain the viewers and herself. At one point, she was just a
                    small streamer of about 200k followers when she announced in late May 2022 she will stream on Twitch full time.
                    This would be the testament towards innovative streams at insane degrees. She wasn't being sponsored
                    previously, but with so many opportunities knocking at her PC, branched out to more VTubers. This was
                    I think the first time that she would do collaborations at this frequency. Her schedule changes a few
                    months prior was a starting point to draw more people to attend to her streams. It wouldn't be just VRChat
                    that's the main focal point, and this was at the same time I started to believe that she could be useful
                    for once. Within her powers come a contract: I will pursue my endeavours to stream lots of new content for
                    you guys and I've been dreaming about this ever since. And 2022 rolled by without a single controversy (at
                    least that's what I've been told), and her popularity soared to 600k followers by April 2023. Surely there's
                    not going to be any dry content I'm used to seeing and just stop watching her. But did I miss the mark
                    about this assumption for literally everything I see in the internet? There are possibly other content 
                    creators that did the same thing at large scales who had the most fun interacting with fans across the globe.
                    If I were to invest in doing something like this, participating in whatever the creator decides to do for 
                    the sake of monetary disillusionment, then so be it! I would take on this challenge and prove to myself
                    that the sacrifice towards contributing the community of millions of people will take serious amounts of
                    efforts. And I was wrong.
                </p><br>
                <h2>and then, a sudden announcement! --&gt;</h2>
                <p>In late May of 2023, Filian deides to annouce something that she never told us since joining Mythic. She 
                    had been working on a secret project that bases off on communities upon communities of creators that
                    they tend to care since starting one. If you were to ever go to daycare, chances are you would be bound 
                    to explore so many things that greatly fascinates someone. Or maybe if you have ever been on a field trip
                    with the class, and suddenly you look back thinking this is the best shit I experienced ever (unless you're 
                    terminally online your whole life, but I'm afraid you wouldn't get my analogy). But here's the thing: what
                    about an award show? "Bruh, you couldn't possibly make it out of the controversy blackhole by doing this.
                    I'm seen past events and many, many videos explaining the downfall of creators that do this for clout. I 
                    have a great sense of urgency to cyberbully my creator just because I want Ironmouse to win everything! Suck
                    my fucking dick and kys!" If being on the internet long enough made you psychologically brain-fried, then
                    why spite them just because someone is so committed to doing the biggest projects and you ruining it? At
                    least, that's one of the biggest concerns with events like this that falls short. And this would've been 
                    detremental to one's mental psyche that just never escapes itself. I had this worrying effect that these
                    people would do anything to stop this from happening. But being that this would be some sort of award show,
                    what would that be like? That was her announcement. She even tweeted that day that she will host the VTuber 
                    Awards come 12/16/23. And this was huge news. Articles like Dexerto even interviewed Filian on the matter 
                    about why this came to be. She said something like: "Itâ€™s a very diverse medium, a lot of VTubers create a 
                    ton of really cool content, and thereâ€™s a ton of different categories out there that us VTubers have cemented 
                    ourselves in... Thereâ€™s a lot more to VTubers out there in terms of the different categories and niches, so I 
                    wanted to spotlight it." How exciting!!! Something we can all appreciate that has never been covered by traditional
                    media outlets like FoxNews, BBC, RTE, Channel 9, or anywhere else. This rapid development and growth exposes
                    wonderous possibilites to explore this new medium of content creation. But what now? What led up to this point 
                    that created so many memories that even I had to write down on Notepad?
                </p><br>
                <h2>so what now? --&gt;</h2>
                <p>With all this hype about the VTuber Awards, there must be some tidbits and leaks (mostly) that we're craving
                    up until this point. What even are they? Like Dory, I have to have someone from the community write this down 
                    for me since I couldn't find my way to write this out. Let me settle you on something interesting: I don't 
                    remember what happened. I have someone currently looking through the data and not responding back. The info 
                    will just have to wait until then. And yes, I have school and I won't come back to this probably in a long
                    time (like all the other Wikis).
                </p><br>
                <h2>the week of reckoning. and the VTuber Awards --&gt;</h2>
                <p>The days are fast approaching, and No Nut November ended sometimes ago. It was just too much for us Snackers to
                    even witness this event happening live. Will this turn out as expected that will blow her budget skyhigh, or her 
                    worst nightmare since streaming? Do we finally have the answer to all of our questions since May? And then on
                    December 16th, 2023 at 22:00 UTC, she went live. If you watch the VOD somewhere, I'm sure you'll figure it out
                    yourself why this was such a huge event for the community.
                </p><br>
                <h2>aftermath --&gt;</h2>
                <p>What an event it was! Man, this was something I never expect to see from all this happening before, during, and 
                    after the Awards. I couldn't believe it! Totally piqued my expections. In all seriousness, there are a lot of
                    moving parts that made the show happen. The guys in Ukraine who only do ESports stuff were very intrigued by
                    this Award Show layout that Filian had to pitch to them a crash course of VTubing. And I am seriously proud 
                    of them. Not very much scuff from what I can tell, apart from the funny moments/clips that had happened since.
                    This would not be possible without the many people (and Snackers) working on it that costed $100,000 to
                    produce. Yes, that was the budget! I always want something new and innovative that will make me curious and 
                    even do projects on, just so I wouldn't dry myself out in the sea of repetition, and the changing times.
                    I'm glad I get to even be a part of the Snackers community and making this website happen because I chose 
                    this to be a part of my hobby and for me to graduate university. It's a new concept for me doing this for you,
                    but I welcome this challenge of trying new things. Even if it's 10 years, and 10 Awards Shows, I hope this 
                    stays around. If you've been this far into reading this, thank you! I'm terrible at writing stuff like this, so 
                    please forgive me and not everything in here is true, but it's close enough. See you for the next one, I guess.
