                <dd><i>This is a website about Filian. She's short, hyper, and likes fruit snacks (Welches', specifically).</i></dd>

                <html><h2>Dude. Why are you doing ASMR? I can't hear you?</h2></html>
                <dd><i><a href="message.txt" download>Here it is</a></i></dd>

                <dt><h2>Can I change/edit the content of the website?</h2></dt>
                <dd><i>No. I'm the sole person responsible for creating this. DM me to request those changes.</i></dd>

                <dt><h2>Some of the links say "coming soon" or something. Are you hiding something?</h2></dt>
                <dd><i>I have a list that will make this better. I'm still learning how to do this, so please be patient. You can DM
                    me if you want to suggest changes I should make. I don't mind. 
                </i></dd>

                <dt><h2>You're not a <i>real</i> smacker if you haven't subbed to her. Your usename says you don't have one. Be one of us.</h2></dt>
                <dd><i>Let's just say I found other ways to watch her streams.</i></dd>

                <dt><h2>What inspired you to create this website for Filian? Why Filian, specifically?</h2></dt>
                <dd><i>This was a passion project of mine. I am a fan of her streams since May 8th, 2022. The making of the website
                    came from peer pressure, and no one made one yet (there are 2 I know of). I spent a total of 3 months learning
                    HTML/CSS/JS to make this work. At best, I had never heard of these languages, so this was new to me. Being that
                    her content is matainable to watch for my ADHD brain, I decide it would be the perfect time to skip school to do 
                    this. I had a lot of ups and downs making this, including unexpected challenges. I want to make this accessible
                    for everyone who watches Filian (or doesn't) so that it can still be as entertaining. I hope that makes sense.
                </i></dd>

                <dt><h2>Any plans for the future?</h2></dt>
                <dd><i>In this case, I want to make a website that encompasses myself and ADHD, even though I'm not diagnosed with one.
                    I'm not sure yet, but I think AI may help a lot in the making of this, so I'm sure it's going to be a great
                    experience to learn some of these things. 
                </i></dd>

                <dt><h2>Are you a mod?</h2></dt>
                <dd><i>I would like to be, but not really. I have school.</i></dd>

                <dt><h2>Why is the website so ugly?</h2></dt>
                <dd><i>That's just my prefered style (for now), and I have no designer experience. I can't guarantee professionalism in
                    this way. I just started learning these languages. It's like every Filian stream where everything is scuffed. I'm
                    trying my best here, man.

                <dt><h2>Did you make everything yourself. That banner looks cool.</h2></dt>
                <dd><i>Yes, I made that one and the website.</i></dd>

                <dt><h2>I noticed you differed your username by one character. What does this mean?</h2></dt>
                <dd><i>SSSSSSHHHHHHHHHH............</i></dd>

                <dt><h2>Fun fact about you?</h2></dt>
                <dd><i>I hold my pen like a 4 year old.</i></dd>

                <dt><h2>I'm confused on how you name versions. Can you explain this to me?</h2></dt>
                <dd><i>I have no idea. I'm still working on that.</i></dd>

                <dt><h2>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</h2></dt>
                <dd><i>What is this? An interview?</i></dd>

                <dt><h2>I think the people made plenty of websites about her already. We don't need someone making a new one. Why you?</h2></dt>
                <dd><i>Again, this is a passion project of mine. I want to share this website with the community that I respect. I've grinded
                    for 3 months to make this come true. It would be my first breakthrough project as a CS major that I can say was fun to 
                    make, despite sacrificing 3 months of normal sleep hours. I love doing this. 
                </i></dd>

                <dt><h2>Are there any secrets to this website?</h2></dt>
                <dd><i>I don't hide them.</i></dd>

                <dt><h2>Were the quotes and fact from Filian really true? I need to know.</h2></dt>
                <dd><i>This not may be what you like to hear, but portions of Filian's humour uses "sarcasm," which I value highly.</i></dd>

                <dt><h2>Why are there too few sections that are arbituarily long? What gives.</h2></dt>
                <dd><i>I had an impending deadline, and I can't add many more sections that's gonna ruin my life. I like to keep
                    things simple and stick to what I have at my disposal. That should be enough. I'll add more if I feel like it,
                    but that requires more research (and I don't like to read, or watch the vods). DM me.

                <dt><h2>Favorite song?</h2></dt>
                <dd><i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej3_8AL8a88" target="_blank">This one</a></i></dd>

                <dt><h2>Hi, I'm a Smacker. I've subbed with Filian for 6 months and I gotta say: this shit slaps. You got the banner,
                    logo, sections about her, everything. I read the whole thing and it blows my mind to see what progess you've come to.
                    I wanna know, man. Do you think I can become as successful as her one day? I think she's pretty hot and sexy and I'm 
                    fucking steaming rn.
                </h2></dt>
                <dd><i>Put it this way: Filian would like that if you stay on the other side of the globe and get a job. Other than that,
                    the website I'm making will definitely make you cum, so stick around for that if that's what you want.
                </i></dd>

                <dt><h2>Hi, I'm one of Filian's mods. I appreciate the effort in creating a website for her. But I do need to clarify the 
                    rules we implemented on our Filcord. You broke rules 4 and 11, in that it was on #community-creations, which is not
                    for Filian (even if it is), and it was promotion for your website. Do I have to go through all your chat logs on both
                    Twitch and Discord to see if you're behaving?
                </h2></dt>
                <dd><i>I'm just following orders. I ensure that none of her personal information is leaked here. Listen to the audio
                    again and it should make sense.
                </i></dd>

                <dt><h2>Hi, I'm Filian. Ignore what my mods had to say. I think you are respected in this community and I thank you from
                    the bottom of my heart for making this website for me. Seriously, 3 months? That's a lot of hard work. I hope to see
                    this in the near future and hope your successes as a CS major spread my website to everyone. I love it so much ðŸ’œðŸ’œ
                </h2></dt>
                <dd><i>Thanks, Fil. I will vow to keep this passion project going so I can add even more features to this website.
                    I have some exciting projects I wanted to work on for a while, so I hope you can wait on that soon so I can show it
                    to you. DM me if you want more info about why I did this.

                <dt><h2>I sent you something on Ask Me Something. Did you see my message?</h2></dt>
                <dd><i>I don't have a database yet, nor do I know what it is. It's better to DM me on Discord (for now) and we could
                    sort this out.
                </i></dd>

                <dt><h2>Will you announce the updates on the website in #community-creations?</h2></dt>
                <dd><i>I don't wanna spam updates in #community-creations everytime I changed the website. It's better to keep
                    this a surprise. Even if I do the announcements, there's no leniancy and people will just lose interest. The 
                    website I posted is the only exception because I want to share what I made. This also means I have no notification
                    system set up because, again, I don't how that works.
                </i></dd>

                <dt><h2>I noticed you only styled the index, and not the other html files.</h2></dt>
                <dd><i>What I plan to do is that if I'm going to create an actual website, I needed a way to practise with what I have
                    already. It's going to take a bit of thinking and conjuring preferences that I can be comfortable in. But yes,
                    I plan to make this way better and accessible to everyone, so this is where I play around with it to see which is
                    better for me.
