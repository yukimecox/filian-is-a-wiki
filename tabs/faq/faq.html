                <dd class="faq-answer"><i>This was a passion project of mine. I am a fan of her streams since May 8th, 2022. I was peer-pressured into
                    making the website. I spent a total of 3+ months over one summer learning everything I could.
                    I had a lot of ups and downs making this, including unexpected challenges. I want to make this accessible
                    for everyone who watches Filian (or doesn't) so that it can still be as entertaining. This isn't a one-and-done
                    project; I still want to master the techniques many people used so it looks better. And that won't be for a long
                    time. I hope that makes sense.

                    which things I'll create in the future, but I do have a list for the website that I could implement (if i can figure
                    how the fuck to do this without spending months on one thing).
