Hey Snackers.

I want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart for seeing this website,
whether you've explored already, or had to listen to my audio message first.
It's scary doing this, knowing that this shit would never work, and I hope
that isn't the case.

To start, I developed this website 3 months ago out of ambition of the streamer
Filian. She's the one who made my viewing experience enjoyable, at best, and I
very much enjoy her streams from the start. What made me do this came to me from
one of the Snackers who implemented her in the VTuber Wiki. I think that was back
in March of 2023. I had this dream one night and said that "I can make this better."
After contemplating for 2 months, and given the amount of peer pressure that someone
else will make the website first, I had to give it a try. The day university ended,
I sat down and looked up some tutorials on how to make a webiste from scratch. For
the ensuing 3 months of constant bombardment of things that don't work, inevitable
lines of code that will fuck up everything if I mess with it, design challenges,
and the 3 hours of sleep on average doing this for my own good, I can proudly say
this is one of the best projects I did in a long time. Most of the times it's a 
one-and-done thing, like just making the website and abondon it. What I do here is 
different: it's supposed to be a Wiki about Filian, but with a twist. The wording
may be off (somewhat???), but I think that gets the job done. With your support,
I think we can make this way better and I'll definitely add more things in the future 
(if I have free time).

Also, I need to note something important for the mods to hear. I value the
privacy of Filian and substantially considered which info about Filian should be shown.
I like to hint at sarcasm for funsies, but for the most part, the things you see are
pulled from streams on Twitch/YouTube (and nothing else outside of that). I understand
the predicament of Smackers ruining the fun for everyone, and I'm trying my best not
to be biased towards that. I want to make this as "community-oriented" as possible so 
there's nothing that would guarantee doxxing, which would be bad for all of us. I want
to make this as fun as her streams. I hope that makes sense.

Anyway, I need to sleep right now. It's 4 AM and I need to go back to university shortly.
I'll try my best to keep watching you from time to time and maybe talk to you guys cuz
I never do it. Uh... yea. Alright, good night, guys!
