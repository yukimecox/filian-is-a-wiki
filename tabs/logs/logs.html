                            to stylize the FAQ for now. I was planning to make pop-ups of categories with the questions, but it was more 
                            complicated than I expected. Soon though! Promise?**</li>
                        <li>An extra Instagram link is now deleted. Oopsie Daisies.</li>
                        <li>The buttons for the Pseudo-Linktree are now associated with the logo colours! Clicky-clicky.</li>
                        <li>The video on the right side now has more room from the bottom margin. Now we're getting consistent!</li>
                        <li>The video in question is now more "defined."</li>
                        <li>The website title header is now spaced out so it isn't just one word (For my dyslexic homies).</li>
                        <li>Updated the questions and answers to the <a href="/tabs/faq/faq.html">FAQ</a>.</li>
                        <li>Okay, for the record, I wanted Gilian to appear like 50% percent of the time for the Ask Me Something page. This should
                            also apply for those on mobile, which now has <span style="font-size: x-large;">bigger</span> texts. If it didn't change,
                            then I'm sorry about that (I might have to rewrite the thing again from scratch to make this work).

                        <li>There are some webpage drafts you can find somewhere. They help me set up the page much more visually.</li>
