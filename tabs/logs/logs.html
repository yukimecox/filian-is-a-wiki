                        <li>Current file size in about 570MB.</li>
                        <li>I wrote something for the VTuber Awards (finally). As stated in the FAQ, these are not meant to be precise,
                            and I don't want to spend my last braincells looking this up. DM me or something.

                        </li>
                        <li>Added chill music you can click at your own descretion (tw: seizures/loud sounds/death)</li>
                        <li>Okay, I said I wasn't gonna stylize the FAQ, but I did. Now including dropdowns so you won't be bombarded with 
                            the answers. Check them out!
                        </li>
                        <li>Minorly changed the About Section, which will now generate text when you click play! It's like Chat-GPT, but not
                            really modified to be a LLM (hint: i did not change anything to it). Oh yeah, if you're wondering about the extra 
                            space, it's just a feature, since it will fill up the space for the text anyway.
                        </li>
                        <li>I think that's all I want to cover for the main features. The rest you have to explore yourself. Next update will
                            not be for a long time because I have university, and even if I did find the time to do the hobby, it's gonna put
                            more pressure and work, so that's not gonna happen. I will spend enough time to do it whenever I want. Thanks for
                            understanding. See you soon!

                        <li>Lesson learned: do not copy your project for achival purposes. It will FUCK UP everything and will not push the 
                            updates. So, no archives are being requested right now (unless you have Internet Wayback Machine).

                            My stupid ass forgot to include the meta tags and I did not notice since that HTML file was created 2 months 
                            ago! I'm gonna be on my deathbed by this point.

                        </li>
                        <li>In other news, I finally made the facts and quotes more nicer to read (and colour-coded). Check it out!</li>
                        <li>Finally realised you can move the styles of each HTML file separately, and now my style folder should populate
                            and that the contents are the same as it is. I was gonna do the same for JS on the animations, but this is only
                            temporary, as I plan to add stuff there anyway.
                        </li>
                        <li>Quotes are now based on the !quote commands. I preface this that these aren't exact wordings, but approximate to
                            the stream. Thanks <a href="https://discordapp.com/users/159344365989265408" target="_blank">@shuvi_ai</a> for writing them down.

                        <li>Rephrased the FAQ.</li>
                        <li>I have a busy semester, chat. Sorry that there's barely any updates. But hopefully get back into the swing of
                            things afterwards. I'm going indoor skydiving in mid-December. It's gonna be super fun. I'll let you know how 
                            it is the day of the VTuber Awards. Thanks again for the support!
                        </li>
                        <li>Oh, one more thing. There will be a section dedicated to the VTuber Awards. I'll decide what to do with it come 
                            January.

                            also apply for those on mobile, which now has <span style="font-size: x-large;">bigger</span> texts. If it didn't change,
                            then I'm sorry about that (I might have to rewrite the thing again from scratch to make this work).
