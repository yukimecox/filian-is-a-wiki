                            <p>Who the fuck is Filian? Why does she sound like a prepubescent boy who barely made it through
                            adulthood? Who let that cringe kid get a career as a streamer? 
                            <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">when will she ever debut???</span>
                            </p>
                            <p>If you have wondered for a long time why we let her be who she is, this was something I want to
                                write about since creating this website. After all, what's a Filian without even mentioning
                                who she is. In essence, Filian (perceived as 
                                <a href="/images/rachel-explained.png" target="_blank" title="IT'S A JOKE! STOP ASKING ME IF IT'S HER REAL NAME!!!">"Rachel"</a>, 
                                if smackers take this information too seriously) 
                                is a catgirl on the internet who does weird things. Known for doing physical gymnastics,
                                flashbangs, edgy jokes, and that one time she's homeless, suddenly became who she is today.
                                My first taste on Filian came about in late April 2022 when she did a short from a Beat Saber stream
                                in 2021 I found in my recommend feed before YouTube segregated them as a tab. Very much it was her
                                saying the along the lines of, "No real fruit! No Mott's! No preservatives! No originals! Only Welch's!"
                                That triggered something in my brain that made me tickle inside that springs ADHD in both of us,
                                which I'd say never happened in many years. This not only changed my perspective on VTubers as
                                a platform of content, but as a personal gratitude I think many people will come to love.
                                She's definitely what you call a "smacker", and I would admit I'm not one of them, thank god!
                                Through many personal hardships I had since childhood, there was finally solice that I could
                                turn to if I ever feel there's something wrong with me, especially during university. No one 
                                else does this but her, and there's so much creativity that just feels different from many
                                other content creators. Not saying I don't like them, but her own fundamental capabilities to
                                go so far into interacting with them is just mind-blowing without further context, which I couldn't
                                provide because I'm so sleep deprived writing this. Basically, her aspirations to do streaming and
                                that she says she'll stream more in the future makes me want to commit to more of her streams.
                                If you could handle this level of ADHD and keep up with the edgy jokes she remarks every second,
                                I'm sure you'll enjoy the streams as much as we do.

                        <section id="streaming" class="indent">
                            <p>Now that we have that out of the way, I'm sure you're more interested in the lore behind Filian.
                                Did she hail from outer space and crash-landed on Earth to stream? Did she come out of the factories
                                of China and shipped to the US so she could be an extravagent streamer? Or, and this is the best
                                one I've got, was she a furry from years past, and now streams without ever telling us she's one 
                                of them? Knowing their history, I'm pretty sure it was stemmed from one of those possibilities. But 
                                what I could say here is that all these things I just mentioned connect to one game: VRChat. Yes, 
                                this was what started her career in the VTubing scene, and it was April 2021 that launched herself 
                                in this game. But wait a minute! I'm wrong about this date being her official debut (no relation).
                                She actually told this story before that her personal addiction to VRChat started during the onset
                                of the COVID-19 Pandemic in early 2020. Now we can confirm that she was still in her furry self before
                                she started streaming, but gradually became her "all-time favourite game ever!" (although I'll point
                                out that there was another game she played before this, and there's a clip from it I found a good while
                                ago of her playing it, but that's another story).
                            </p>
                            <p>Anyway, since becoming a VTuber, Filian quickly found many intuitive ways to makes her streams more
                                enjoyable that had us vibrating our chairs intensely. Besides
                                screaming into the mic every 5 minutes, she does collabs with other VTubers. Examples include:
                                AkumaNihmune, CottontaleVA, Shylily, baoo, Camila, ProjektMelody, Yuzu, LucyPyre, Saruei, Pippa, 
                                Trickywi, and other larger, more personal creators. I don't know why Filian had to pick them out of the many
                                others she could've collaborated with, but take this with a grain of salt if you can to save yourself.
                                She also does You Laugh, You Lose streams every Saturday, but that could change if she decides to
                                be weird about it. There are also some things she also can do, such as rizzing up Snackers at level 
                                uncomparable to the delight of famous TikTok celebrities of today. She could also give advice that 
                                could definitely help people find someone they could love and have relationships with (at least I 
                                don't fall in line to this behaviour, but it's at least funny to think about). There are many more 
                                things that I could come up with that makes Filian a speical place in my heart as a non-parasocial 
                                Snacker and it would probably take up like 50% of the Wiki if I keep going with this, so I'll leave
                                you to discover other contents yourselves. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that she did the VTuber Awards. That's next!</p>

                                Some say it was just a fluke. Others say it's so bad you really thought she actually said this.
                                And according to my sources, it's very much true down to the character. I wouldn't bother writing
                                the quotes exactly, but these are close enough. After you've finished reading them, I want you to feel
                                like you're actually Filian and stream like this. Oh yeah, someone once did commands for quotes, so it
                                looks like I'll be the one responsible for quoting Filian from now on. Plus, these are never-before seen 
                                quotes that aren't on the commands list. Hope this is still accurate.
