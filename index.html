                        <p style="color: white;">Yes. It's real.</p>
                        <p>I made this website made for the Filian community that took 3 months to make and I can't be
                            very thankful for those involved. Maybe this is the first time you're seeing this, and that it's a 
                            wiki about Filian, right? Well, not really. Did you know that everybody who reads a Wiki article 
                            gloss over 99% of filler information than what was actually said? Could it be something I made up? 
                            Idk. The average time I spent reading a Wiki is like 10 seconds, but that depends on how desperate 
                            you are. I should note that despite the vast amounts of clips of Filian in the media, I can't guarantee
                            that any of these are factual (according to my memory). It's all just for shits and giggles. I hope you
                            believe in me. Tired of reading things I "said" in the Wiki? Click some links in the sidebar to explore. 
                            I hope you have a good day. Did I mention that I had an average of 3 hours sleep getting this website 
                            done on a deadline?

                        <p>Filian is a streamer. What about him? You might have seen clips of his Omegle interactions,
                            or one time hosted a live dating show that he absolutely did not rip off with a bunch of
                            VTubers he's never interacted with. Or maybe he falls all the time and likes to make obscene 
                            jokes about his nuts. I bet that he can possess the ability to rizz anybody (even chat) and 
                            get hot chicks in just 2 words. "That's cringe!" You exclaim. He's more than just being cringe.
                            He can be as wholesome as any other VTuber whose chaos and destruction become indiscernible
                            without knowing why you want to watch him in the first place. This is where we, the Snackers,
                            come in. Our pristine members of our Discord community share ideas/memes pertaining to things
                            we love about her 24/7. It could also be something else that isn't Filian. Issues with your PC?
                            We're right here. Drafted pieces of art? We would love to see them. Making a website that is
                            definitely not for Filian? I'm right here. We love his streams and will continue to do so until
                            our sausages are burnt to a crisp. Did I mention you need to read the rules first before doing the
                            things I listed here?

                        <p>Usually VTubers have lore. To this day, I don't really know if he has one or not. All I remember
                            from that one stream goes something like: "I live inside of a cardboard box that's parked right
                            outside the Welch's Fruit Snack Factory. I am waiting for that sponsorship so I can eat all of 
                            them and become rich." Others suggest his actual story about VRChat, maybe like: "One day, I 
                            found this game called VRChat, and I have been addicted to it since." It could be worse. Ask
                            any Snacker and they'll tell you that she was born a Vaporeon, for example. Did I mention he has 
                            an unhealthy relationship with Sailor Moon and Sailor Moon merchandise?<br>
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            Okay, so what content does <span class="underline-thickness">FILIAN</span> like to do? Besides
                            screaming into the mic every 5 minutes, he does collabs with other VTubers. Examples include:
                            AkumaNihmune, CottontaleVA, vedal987 (Neuro-sama), Shylily, LaynaLazar, baoo, henyathegenius, 
                            Camila, ProjektMelody, and some other larger creators. Not gonna lie, the VTubers listed here 
                            sit at the very edge of the most sussy and eye-catching on a hypothetical scale between virginity 
                            and impurity. For the record, let's just say Filian had a great time being exposed to lewd interests. 
                            He even says some on streams for the fun of it. Lewdness is mentioned every collab. When he's by 
                            himself, we can't always forget the Saturday Night Classic of the YLYL challenge. How it works is that 
                            on the Filcord in Discord, you go read the rules (FIRST!!!!!!) and find the one that either says 
                            #funny-vids-for-saturday or #YLYL-punishments. In other words, what will most likely make him laugh, 
                            and what will most likely make him suffer. Personally, I find that closing his tabs to be a great 
                            punishment idea because he likes to be masochistic about it. Yes, masochism is what YLYL is all about, 
                            and we crave that very much. Other contents he provides are: sponsorship games (collect anime waifus); 
                            YLYL variants (YCYC); VTuber Got Talent; fricking around for 30 minutes (he used to this for an hour 
                            before switiching to a react segment after May 2023); scuff tech support (yes, this is part of his 
                            stream etiquette); horror nights; and scuff in general. Did I mention the insane timed chat interactions 
                            on some compilations that makes streams way more engaging?
