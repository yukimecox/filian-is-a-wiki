Hi. My name is Yuki (yukimecoc#6863) and I made this website. I am majoring in CS in some college, though I don't know which CS field specifically. 
I've never coded a website before and this is my excuse to learn it whilst having a mental breakdown haha. 
Any suggestions appreciated (like how to make this website look cleaner and nicer). 
Also, this is the first time in my life I'll be involved in the Snackers community, so please request any feedback about my performance. 
DM me or whatever if you have any concerns. You can find it somewhere on discord.
